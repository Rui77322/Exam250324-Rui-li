# How to use the command DIR


Dir is a command used to display the list of all the files and subfolders contained in a folder. These two websites show us how to use this command.

One is from an authoritative website ，Micosoft learn, the other one is from the Lifewire.

Both of them show us what the dir command is used to, the syntax and what the different Parameters display.And the most advantage is both of them give us several examples,which is good for beginners.

These two articles also give us their outlines at the beginning ,so that we can quickly find what we want.

The introduction on the first site,Microsoft Learn is quite normal，comprehensive and detailed；while the second one,Life Wire, is simple.

We should notice although dir is a simple and common command ,it can display different content with different switches.For example

"dir /b" only displays the name of the folders and files in the current directory and not attributes like file size and time stamps.
